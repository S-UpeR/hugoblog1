On a sweltering summer day in 2016, as the scorching sun beat down relentlessly on the streets of Delhi, a 17-year-old college girl sought refuge in the incredible depths of Palika Bazaar. This bustling underground market was a vibrant maze of shops and alleys, offering a captivating array of goods to entice shoppers. Carrying her laptop bag casually over her shoulder, the girl embarked on a leisurely exploration of the market. The bazaar offered an eclectic mix of stalls, showcasing everything from fashionable clothing and trendy accessories to cutting-edge electronics and captivating books. The air was filled with enticing fragrances, while the alleys bustled with the animated chatter of vendors and eager shoppers.

Battling the relentless heat, the girl reached into the side pocket of her bag and retrieved her trusty water bottle. The refreshing liquid provided a momentary respite from the sweltering temperatures as she savoured its coolness. As she sipped her water, her gaze wandered, and it fell upon a gleaming brown handbag displayed in a shop window. Intrigued, she was drawn to its exquisite craftsmanship and elegant design. Noticing her interest, the shopkeeper, ever-alert for potential customers, approached her with a friendly smile. With an air of enthusiasm, he began extolling the virtues of the handbag, proudly proclaiming its pure leather origins imported all the way from Japan. He sought to captivate her interest and persuade her to purchase by skillfully showcasing its impeccable design and craftsmanship.

Intrigued by the shopkeeper's sales pitch, the girl was captivated by the handbag's exquisite craftsmanship. Sensing a potential sale, the shopkeeper called upon his trusted salesmen, Genda and Chuha, to showcase an array of other captivating bags. Displaying a diverse range of colours, designs, and sizes, they skillfully tempted her with the unique features of each bag. Genda, one of the salesmen, noticed her now-empty water bottle and acted quickly, taking the bottle from her and disappearing momentarily to refill it with refreshing cold water. Returning with the replenished bottle, he offered it to her with a polite smile. However, her infatuation with the exquisite brown handbag remained steadfast, and the girl couldn't resist inquiring about its price. With a brief pause, the shopkeeper dramatically revealed the figure - a staggering 4000 rupees. Just then, a young man named Prateek, in his twenties, entered the shop, arriving late and drawing the ire of the shopkeeper. As punishment, Prateek offered a new mobile phone as compensation for his tardiness. The shopkeeper's face instantly lit up with delight as he exclaimed, "Oh, cool!"

Engrossed in the captivating exchange between the girl and the shopkeeper, they engaged in a spirited negotiation and bargaining game. Back and forth they went, each trying to secure the best deal. After much haggling and persuasion, the shopkeeper relented, agreeing to sell the alluring leather handbag to the girl for a significantly reduced price of 1000 rupees. Just as the deal was sealed, the girl's phone rang, and her mother was on the other end. Concerned about her daughter's safety and well-being, she scolded her for not opting for an air-conditioned train ticket. She voiced her worries about the long journey from Delhi to Bangalore.
Her mother suggested buying a flight ticket instead. Still, the girl insisted she would be fine and wanted to enjoy the journey in a sleeper-class train compartment. Unfortunately, her conversation with her mother was not as private as she thought, and the shopkeeper overheard her discussion. He inquired why she wasn't travelling with her friends, and the girl explained that they had gone to see the Taj Mahal, an attraction she wasn't particularly interested in visiting. Later, as the girl realized she had forgotten an essential item, her train ticket, she requested a printout from the shopkeeper. Showing great kindness, he obliged and instructed Prateek to assist her. After complying with the shopkeeper's request, Prateek helped the girl and bid her farewell as she left the shop.

Prateek returned with a mischievous smile, waving an A4 paper. Intrigued, the shopkeeper asked what he was holding. Prateek's eyes gleamed as he replied, "It's a ticket to today's adventure." Genda and Chuha leaned in to take a peek. The shopkeeper, a bit hesitant, said, "Forget it, she's just a young girl, and we've been having a rough time this month." Prateek's mischievous smile widened as he countered, "Brother, So what, if she is a young girl, she got the bag for 1000, hardly leaving any profit to us. She needs to be taught a lesson, and by the looks of her, she has a lot of fortune with her."

The shopkeeper glanced at Genda and Chuha, who shook their heads disapprovingly. Prateek continued his persuasion, "Why bother asking them? They narrowly escaped the clutches of the Delhi Police last month when they attempted to sell a stolen iPhone on OLX to its original owner. The police are still hunting for them, remember?" and reassured the shopkeeper, "Don't fret. I am not like them. Look, today I swiftly acquired an iPhone without exerting much effort." Reluctantly, the shopkeeper relented, saying, "Alright." Just as Prateek prepared to depart, the shopkeeper interjected, "Wait, on your way back, please deliver this 4000 rupees to Ahmad in Kashmiri Bazaar. Don't forget." Genda and Chuha mockingly wished him luck, jesting, "Best of luck, don't get caught... It would be utterly embarrassing if a girl were to apprehend you." Prateek smirked, exchanging knowing glances with Genda and Chuha, and confidently assured them, "Have no fear, I won't get caught... I have your blessings, after all."

The girl, filled with anticipation and nervousness, stepped onto the platform and approached the train. It was her first time travelling on a sleeper-class Indian train, and she couldn't contain her excitement. As she boarded the train, she navigated through the narrow aisles, glancing at the compartment numbers until she found her designated spot. Finding her assigned seat, she settled into the cosy window spot, gazing at the platform bustling with activity. With a soft thud, she placed her laptop bag on the upper side berth, ensuring it was within reach yet safely tucked away. Taking a moment to arrange her belongings, she neatly stowed the rest of her luggage below her seat, securing it against any unexpected jolts and bumps during the journey. Moments later, a young man entered the wagon, catching the girl's attention with his striking appearance. He exuded confidence and charm as he effortlessly settled into the seat before her. Their eyes met briefly, and a smile sparked a sense of connection.

Unable to resist the pull of curiosity, the girl initiated a conversation, their voices mingling with the ambient sounds of the train. Inside the wagon, a vibrant microcosm of life unfolded. Vendors meandered through the narrow aisles, their calls announcing an assortment of delectable snacks, refreshing beverages, and enticing trinkets. Passengers, engrossed in their own conversations or lost in their thoughts, moved about, weaving through the lively tapestry of human interactions.

Seizing the opportunity amidst the commotion, Prateek skillfully retrieved the laptop bag from the upper side berth and discreetly made his way out. He quickly snapped a photo of the bag and sent it to the WhatsApp group "Palika's Best," which included Genda and Chuha.
The accompanying message read, _"That's how you do it üòâ üòÑüëú#successfulheist."_

Chuha responded, _"Our blessings worked like a charm!"_

Genda chimed in, _"Let's celebrate!"_

Prateek playfully retorted, _"You owe me a treat since I'm compensating for you all."_

Unbeknownst to Prateek, the train began to move, and by the time he realized, it had gained speed. Realizing there were no scheduled stops for the next two hours, he contemplated getting off when the train slowed.

As Prateek moved to the other side of the train, contemplating when to disembark, he leaned against the door.
Suddenly, a message popped up in the WhatsApp group from Genda:
_"At least bring 3 chicken noodles with an extra egg; if not, party!"_

Prateek chuckled and replied, _"I wish I could, but not possible today." Chuha immediately asked, "What happened?"_

Prateek quickly responded, _"Still on the train." Chuha was taken aback, replying, "What?!"_

Genda couldn't resist, saying, _"Bro, I hope you haven't fallen in love with the girl and can't bear to leave her ‚ù§Ô∏è... üòÇü§£"_

Chuha said, _"Maybe The girl is taking him to prison on the train!"_

Prateek, slightly annoyed, dismissed their playful banter, replying, _"Alright, enough with the silly jokes. I couldn't get off the train, but I'll make my move at Mathura. Let our boss know I'll be at work by 8pm with a fortune."_

Genda said, _" What's the fortune? May it not be that one is fooled in the name of fortuneü§£ü§£ü§£."_

Filled with anticipation, Prateek eagerly opened the bag and shared in the group, _"MacBook, iPad, and much more... Now you can laugh ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£!"_

Meanwhile, on the train, a vendor passed by the girl's seat, tantalizing her senses with the delicious aroma of salted, buttery, spicy peanuts. Intrigued, she called the vendor over and purchased a packet, for which he charged her 20 rupees. She tasted one of the peanuts and exclaimed, "It's delicious, brother! I will pay you 30" Excitedly, she stood up to retrieve her wallet from her laptop bag, only to find it missing from the seat. Shocked, she quickly checked under her side berth, but all she found was her other luggage. Panic surged through her veins as she realized her laptop bag, containing her money, laptop, and identification cards, was gone. She looked around frantically, hoping to spot any sign of her missing bag. A fellow passenger in the lower berth nonchalantly commented that once something is lost on an Indian train, it's nearly impossible to find it again. She felt helpless and was at a loss for what to do.

The handsome guy sitting with her kindly paid for the peanuts and suggested she search the entire train. Overwhelmed, she searched thoroughly, disturbing many sleeping passengers by asking them to show their bags. As she entered the carriage where Prateek was, her desperate search created commotion and caught his attention. Prateek swiftly moved to another carriage and stumbled upon a foul-smelling bathroom. Opening the door, he noticed the handle was dangerously loose, almost about to break. Seizing the opportunity, he intentionally broke the handle while ensuring no one was observing him. He then locked himself inside the bathroom, seeking temporary refuge.

As the girl continued her search, she went through the narrow aisles of the sleeper class train. Unbeknownst to her, just a few steps away, Prateek held his breath inside the cramped bathroom, his body pressed against the cold walls. He knew the slightest noise or movement could shatter his chances of escaping undetected.

As the girl approached, she reached out to knock on the bathroom door, her anticipation evident in the brief pause that followed. Inside, Prateek's heart raced, his mind racing with thoughts of being discovered. Suppressing his instincts, he remained silent, hoping his stillness would convince her that the broken handle was a minor defect.
Unaware of Prateek's presence, the girl assumed that no one was inside and concluded that the door's broken handle was a defect. With a dismissive gesture, she moved on, her footsteps fading into the distance. Prateek sighed in relief, grateful that his hidden refuge had gone unnoticed. His mobile screen illuminated, signalling a message from Genda in their group chat.
Genda _"Bro ...a slight change of plans ... chicken egg noodles will not suffice for the fortune, add whiskey to that"_

Chuha _" Also soda üòé"_

Irritated by the pungent aroma of the bathroom and his current predicament, Prateek wrote, _"Yeah, you bastards. I'll do the heavy lifting while you reap the rewards. üñïüñï"_

Genda _" Don't get angry. Forget soda; we'll manage with just water. üòÅ"_

Annoyed, Prateek silenced his mobile. Peering through the small aperture in the commode, he glanced at the rapidly passing tracks, the train showing no signs of slowing down. Despite the discomfort, Prateek decided to remain concealed within the confining space of the bathroom, patiently biding his time until the perfect opportunity presented to escape. Just as he thought he had some respite, his phone glowed -an incoming call from Genda. He swiftly declined the call. His phone glowed again, and he again declined it. Increasingly frustrated with the constant interruptions, Prateek contemplated blocking the calls altogether when a text popped up in the group chat. 

Genda's text read, _" Bro, just wanted to inform you since you're coming late, bring the 4000 back. Boss told me to tell you...that's it, and you are blocking my calls. Don't look down on us because your time is going well."_

Chuha, _" All big people are just like that @Genda.It's not his fault."_

Prateek quickly replied, _" Nothing like that, bro. I am still on the train. Understand. I will bring the money back."_ 

Chuha _"I hope everything is well. It's not like you're sitting in the bathroom while trying to escape, and that's why you're upset with us, right? ü§£ü§£"_

Genda _"lol... he is not like us @chuha.be careful with your words with the king of thieves... once he goes on a hunt, he always comes back with a trophy"_ 

Prateek's frustration peaked as he retorted, _"Just shut the fuck up. Both of you. One more text, and there will be no more chicken noodles with whiskey for you."_ 

Genda _"bro...last text of the day... it's chicken eggüçóü•ö noodles with whiskey and soda if possible...if not fine...water is there." Finally, the messages ceased, and Prateek felt a sense of relief."_

Meanwhile, the girl searched throughout the train but was in vain, holding back tears; regret filled her mind as she remembered her mother's advice to travel in an air-conditioned compartment or by flight. Exhausted, returning to her seat, she shared her predicament with the handsome guy. He sympathetically offered to lend her money, suggesting she could transfer the amount to him once she reached home. Anger welled up within her as his offer seemed to mock her misfortune. Another middle-aged woman occupying the middle berth chimed in, stating that getting angry now was futile and emphasizing the importance of being cautious from the beginning. Another passenger added, "That's why girls should never travel alone," further fueling the girl's anger and frustration.

Driven by her emotions, she embarked on another search, but to no avail. Prateek remained hidden in the bathroom, refusing to come out. The relentless motion of the train, coupled with the unbearable stench emanating from the unwashed space, made him feel nauseous. In his discomfort, Prateek desperately sought some respite. He noticed a small bottle of water on the side of the bag on his lap; he seized the bottle and quickly drank, hoping to alleviate his discomfort. Though the water was lukewarm and far from refreshing, it provided temporary relief. 

While the girl moved towards the other end of the train, she encountered two police constables who noticed her distress and offered help and assured her that the train had not slowed down since its departure and had yet to make any scheduled stops, so the thief is still onboard and could be apprehended. Together, they embarked on a thorough search, meticulously inspecting every bogie to find the culprit, but also made sure to not disturb the sleeping passengers. 

Prateek's heart pounded in his chest as he heard the girl's voice and the distinct voices of two others, which he quickly deduced as police, given their tone and mannerisms. Fearful, he attempted to exit the bathroom, only to discover it was locked. Shocked, he strained to open the door silently but failed. Realizing he was trapped, he resigned himself to sitting on the commode. Contacting Genda and Chuha crossed his mind, but he was swiftly dismissed due to the fear of humiliation. He tried calling the shopkeeper, but there was no answer.

A minute later, the policemen knocked on the bathroom door, but there was no response. The girl informed them it had been defective the last two times and hadn't opened. Initially believing it to be a defect, the police were about to move on. However, the sudden deceleration of the train caused Prateek's bag to slip from his lap and make a noise as it hit the floor. The noise was masked by the train's abrupt braking, but a bottle rolled out from the bag a second later. Prateek swiftly placed his right foot on it to prevent it from rolling further. But it was late, as it drew the suspicion of the girl and the policemen. At the same time, Prateek's nausea resurfaced, causing vomit to rise in his mouth. He desperately fought to hold it back, placing a hand over his mouth.

The police instructed the girl to wait until the next station and request assistance from the station crew to open the door. However, the girl, unwilling to wait, resorted to force, kicking and jumping against the door with her shoulders to break it open. The police initially tried to restrain her but eventually joined in their efforts to open the door.
Finally, their combined strength succeeded, and the door swung open. As the door opened, the vomit in Prateek's mouth surged forward, spilling onto one of the police officers who had just entered the bathroom. Unfazed by the unfortunate incident, the girl spotted the bag lying on the floor and swiftly retrieved it. Realizing he had been caught, Prateek made a desperate attempt to run. However, one of the officers, whose uniform had been dirtied by the earlier vomit, reacted and struck Prateek hard across the face. The impact caused the remaining vomit to forcefully eject from Prateek's mouth, again landing on the same police officer. The officer, now thoroughly agitated, prepared to strike Prateek again but was restrained by his fellow officer, who teasingly remarked, "I think two rounds of vomit on you is more than enough. Go and clean yourself in the other bathroom; I will handle this."

Prateek, his appearance dishevelled and embarrassed, was escorted out of the bathroom by the police, drawing the attention of curious onlookers. The girl was relieved to find her belongings intact except for the vomit-drenched bag. Meanwhile, the police urged the other passengers to disperse, clearing the area. Following the police instructions, Prateek obediently washed away the vomit. Still, he kept his face down, attempting to conceal his identity from the girl. When asked for his train ticket, Prateek feigned a search through his wallet, pretending that he had misplaced it during his journey.
 
While Prateek searched for the non-existent ticket, the girl caught a glimpse inside his wallet. She noticed around 4,000 rupees- a 4 thousand rupee note and some loose change. The girl rechecked her vomit-drenched bag and claimed she had found everything except some money. When the police inquired about the amount missing, she stated, "4,000 rupees." Prateek realized that the girl was attempting to loot his money and promptly revealed his face, vehemently denying any involvement in stealing from her bag.

In a turn of events, the girl recognized Prateek as the person from the shop. She immediately informed the police of their previous encounter. Prateek was left stunned and helpless, unsure of what to do next. At that moment, Prateek received a call from the shopkeeper, who had a missed call from him earlier. The police instructed Prateek to answer the call and put it on speakerphone. As the call connected, the shopkeeper said, "Hello, Saap. When are you bringing the fortune?" Prateek, under the watchful eye of the police, responded, "Hello, brother, I will be there by this evening. I'm still on the train, but I'll get down in 10 minutes at Mathura and catch the next train. I'll come back as soon as possible."
The shopkeeper, unaware, continued the conversation, saying, "Good then, while coming, bring only 2 chicken noodles. Genda and Chuha don't deserve any. I am sending them home a bit early. We'll have some drinks and fun. Come fast. We will t alk later," Prateek obediently replies, "Yes, brother," before the call ends. 

The girl, satisfied with the turn of events, pays the police 2000 rupees as a token of gratitude for their assistance and takes her leave. Prateek attempted to convince the police that the money found belonged to him, but his efforts were in vain. Disappointed, the girl returns to her seat, gazing disdainfully at her fellow passengers. As evening fell, the shopkeeper was eventually arrested. However, Genda and Chuha escaped as the shopkeeper sent them home early.
