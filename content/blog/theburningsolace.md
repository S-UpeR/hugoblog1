#### Chapter 1: _Silent Flames_

Struggling to fall asleep, he cautiously unzipped the tent, careful not to disturb his sleeping companions and stepped outside. Extending his arms in a stretch, he meandered aimlessly before settling on a split rail fence facing the shimmering beach. The cool sea breeze kissed his skin, sending pleasant shivers down his spine. Still, he remained oblivious to the chill, with his gaze fixed on the mesmerizing glow emanating from the sea. The rhythmic symphony of crashing waves filled his ears with a melodic lullaby that beckoned him into a realm of deep contemplation. 

Startled by the gentle pat on his shoulder, he swiftly turned his head and, to his surprise, discovered his aunt standing there. She had ventured out of the tent, searching for him, her concerned gaze meeting his.

"Ai view ta amazing re, kintu late ta thoda bahut nahi?" she said, yawning. "Almost 12 am hoichhi, aau ete thanda bhi," she added.
"Yeah, it's late," he responded with a dull voice, "let's head back and catch some sleep." As he prepared to return to the tent, his aunt's gaze turned towards the sky, where the stars twinkled like lanterns, casting a gentle glow across the velvety darkness. It was a mesmerizing sight. Turning to him, she suggested, "Ai fire ta jwaliba, ei ama good view re mote kichi samaya pain au bharijau."

With a perplexed expression, he responded, "I'm sorry, I don't understand."
"But you understood me earlier when I spoke in Odia," his aunt replied.
"Ah, before, I just got the gist of it as you ... mixed some English and Hindi words. You told me that even though the scenery is beautiful, I should go back and sleep because it's already 12 o'clock and cold." "Here, I thought you understood, Odiya...It's fine... I was just saying, Let's light a fire and enjoy this beautiful view for a little longer". 
He exclaimed with a light-hearted tone, finally grasping her words.
"Hmmm, let's make a fire," he said, contemplating the idea.
She looked around and suggested, "Let's make it near the beach. What do you think?"
"Let's do it," he agreed. 

They built a fire and settled down, its warm glow enveloping them. Once again, he found himself lost in his thoughts, almost as if in a trance. Breaking the silence, she said, "Last time I saw you in your college with Sarika, you were a completely different person."
"Different... how?" he inquired, his curiosity piqued.
"You were goofy and funny back then, always doing things that pleased you without worrying too much about others," she explained.
"And now?" he questioned, his voice tinged with melancholy.
"Now, you seem moody and sulky," she replied honestly.
A faint smile played upon his lips, but his eyes betrayed a hint of sadness. "Or... you weren't really interested in this trip, and Sarika convinced you to come along," she said, her gaze shifting towards the tent. "I can't blame her if she did... That's just who she is...," she added affectionately.

"No, no... your lovely daughter didn't force me," he replied. "I was actually happy when she invited me on this trip," he added.
"But your actions show me otherwise," she countered. "Yesterday, you didn't even step inside the Jagannath Mandira, and today, you seem lost in your own world. You've barely spoken more than 10 words in the past two days. What's going on? What is holding you back from being yourself?"
He remained silent, unable to find the words to express his inner turmoil. Everything she said resonated with the truth he had been avoiding.
"Whatever it is keeping you from being yourself, either speak it out or..." she trailed off. He kept his silence, his gaze fixed on the flickering flames of the fire. Then, slowly shifting his gaze towards her, he uttered, "I would like to tell a story."
With a deep breath, he directed his gaze towards the mesmerizing dance of the crackling fire and began weaving the tale.

"It's the story of a young student who excelled in his 10th-grade exams. Like many others, his next step was choosing his pre-university education, either MPC (Maths, Physics, and Chemistry) for Engineering or Bi.P.C. (Biology, Physics, and Chemistry) for Medicine. He decided to go for MPC, which he heard was comparatively easier. His parents enrolled him in a prestigious school with a hefty price tag of 2 lakhs per year, totalling 4 lakhs for the last two years."

"Wow, that must be one of the top schools in the state with excellent facilities," she commented curiously.

He smiled and let out a sigh almost simultaneously. "Yes, it's a three-storied building with five classrooms on the ground floor, hostels, offices and other rooms on the first and second floors, situated on a sprawling 2-acre campus far from the city with barely having any place for sports, except for an improvised beach volleyball field."

Perplexed, "Then why is it so expensive?" she inquired.

"That's because the junior college ensures guaranteed admissions to top engineering colleges across India for most of its graduating students. With limited seats available, only 60 students are accepted each year. It's all about supply and demand. Since he excelled in his 10th-grade exams, he was granted a coveted spot. But there's one crucial detail... It was a boarding junior college. Once he stepped inside those gates, he would be confined within the college premises for two years. He could only leave if his parents came to take him out, or they could contact the Principal for a temporary release in emergencies or holidays, which are rare". 

"Wait, What's the young student's name?" she asked.

"Well... His name is Gopal," he replied. 


#### Chapter 2: _Unexpected Bonds_

He didn't have high expectations from the college, except for a football ground. However, upon seeing the college, his expectations plummeted to zero. All he yearned for now was for the two years to pass quickly. His plan was simple - study, eat, sleep, take exams, secure admission to college, and leave the place as soon as possible. Little did he know that destiny had a different plan for him. 

On Gopal's first day at the boarding junior college, he was in a classroom filled with unfamiliar faces and animated conversations. The atmosphere buzzed with Excitement as students exchanged stories, and anticipation filled the air. Suddenly, a tall and commanding figure entered the room, capturing everyone's attention. It was the Principal, and a hush fell over the classroom as he introduced himself. Gopal observed the authoritative aura emanating from the Principal, leaving an indelible impression on the students. "You sixty are fortunate to have secured admission here," the Principal began, his voice resonating with authority. "So, I expect you to value this chance, if not for yourselves, then at least for your parents' hard-earned money. I only ask you to do two things: Eat, Study, and Sleep Well." Pausing momentarily, the Principal's gaze intensified, "The second, and most important, never do anything that you are not asked to," he warned, his tone firm.

Caught in the moment, Gopal overheard a soft whisper. "It's four, not two rules," the voice said mischievously, followed by a giggle. Intrigued, Gopal turned around and silently signalled the person sitting beside him to remain quiet by placing his finger on his lips. "Hi, I'm Tharun", the whisperer introduced himself in a hushed tone and continued, "Aren't you feeling cold? The AC temperature is set very low."

Before Gopal could respond, the Principal's voice resonated with unwavering authority. "Since you feel cold, kneel for half an hour outside. It will invigorate you. This is the consequence for those who do things you aren't asked to do... Both of you," he commanded. Annoyed yet obedient, Gopal gracefully lowered himself to the ground outside the classroom, refraining from voicing his discontent.

On the other hand, Tarun attempted to explain, "I was merely asking him if he felt cold-" But he was abruptly interrupted by the Principal's stern glare. "Turn off the AC, then proceed outside and kneel," he commanded, a disapproving gaze directed at Tarun. The other students in the classroom looked upon Tarun with exasperation, silently urging him to comply. Understanding their sentiments, Tarun wordlessly went outside, his laughter stifled by a hand pressed against his mouth. Reluctantly, they endured the punishment for the next half hour.

After lunch, Gopal decided to distance himself from Tharun by changing his seat. However, to his surprise, he discovered that Tharun had been assigned as his roommate. Disappointed by the news, Gopal requested a room change, only to be informed that adjustments could only be made after a week.

As Gopal lay in bed that night, a sudden noise startled him awake. He turned to find a faint glow illuminating the darkness emanating from Tharun's hand. Acting swiftly, Gopal switched on the lights and discovered Tharun holding a mobile phone. Startled by the sudden brightness, Tharun realized that the earphone jack had come loose from the device. He swiftly reconnected it and pleaded, "Sorry, just 10 more minutes; it's the final episode of Inazuma 11, please." Reluctantly, Gopal switched off the light and begrudgingly settled back into bed, allowing Tharun to watch his favourite show for a few more minutes. 

Tharun approached Gopal during breakfast the following day and quietly sat beside him. In a hushed tone, he pleaded, "Can you please keep it a secret? I have the mobile to talk with my Mom whenever I miss her."
Gopal replied with a hint of sarcasm, "You used it to watch Inazuma 11, not to talk with your Mom. Besides, there's a coin payphone in the hallway specifically for that purpose."

Tharun quickly retorted, "It was the last episode, and I couldn't resist. I promise it'll be the first and last time I use it for watching Inazuma. As for the payphone, there's always a long queue, and even if you manage to get a turn, you can only talk for a maximum of 2 minutes."

"Just make sure I don't see it," Gopal abruptly left the table.

The following day, during the chemistry class after lunch, the warden abruptly entered the room, making an announcement that caught everyone's attention. He declared that he needed to conduct room inspections due to reports of prohibited items on the premises, including within the classrooms. To avoid any accusations of missing belongings after the search, he requested a student volunteer to assist him in checking the dormitories. Eagerly several students raised their hands, hoping to be chosen. However, the warden's discerning gaze fell upon Gopal, who displayed a lack of interest, and he asked him to accompany him on the search. As Gopal was leaving the classroom, he caught a glimpse of Tharun's face, filled with anger and a sense of betrayal.

With Gopal's assistance, the warden meticulously inspected several rooms, unveiling various prohibited items like mobile phones, video game consoles, and playing cards. Approaching the final room on the list, Gopal's own room, uncertainty washed over him like a wave.

As they began their search, Gopal stumbled upon Tharun's mobile phone, as expected. A dilemma arose within him — should he expose the mobile to the warden or keep it hidden?. He briefly considered handing the mobile to the warden. Still, at that moment, Gopal's mind raced with the potential aftermath- being labelled a snitch and facing scrutiny from his classmates, becoming the villain in their eyes. 

Thinking quickly, Gopal decided-he concealed the mobile in his jacket pocket with a sleight of hand. When the warden momentarily looked away, Gopal discreetly disposed of the mobile by subtly tossing it into the nearby dustbin.

As the search concluded, the warden returned to the classroom with Gopal in tow and promptly warned the students, "These inspections will be conducted frequently and without prior notice. You mustn't keep any prohibited items on this campus. Remember to follow instructions and do only what you are asked to do," he emphasized. "Furthermore, confiscated items will be kept in the Principal's office. They will only be returned to the rightful owners once their parents discuss them with the Principal." With that, the warden exited the classroom with the confiscated items.

The room was filled with curiosity as everyone tried to glimpse the seized items. Tarun, in particular, directed a piercing gaze towards Gopal, his face burning with anger. The room buzzed with anticipation as everyone eagerly awaited the break. They hurriedly made their way to their rooms as soon as the interval arrived, hoping to find their belongings intact. Gopal, too, headed to his room, expecting to witness Tarun's futile search for his missing mobile. As anticipated, he found Tarun standing by his bag, frustration etched on his face as he failed to locate his phone. Assuming that his mobile had been confiscated, Tarun confronted Gopal angrily as he entered the room. "Friends and roommates never snitch on each other. Are you happy now?" he spat out, ready to storm out in a rage. In a calm and measured tone, Gopal responded, "We were never friends, and I didn't snitch on anyone. Perhaps you should put in more effort and check the dustbin." 
To his relief, Tarun quickly checked the dustbin and found his phone nestled among mango peels and drops of curd. Although annoyed by its unflattering placement, he was elated that his mobile had not been confiscated.

Tharun turned to Gopal, a mix of astonishment and gratitude on his face. "Don't you think you owe me an apology?" Gopal said with a straight face.

Tharun's anger melted away, replaced by a sheepish grin. "No sorry and no thanks between friends," he smirked.

Gopal maintained a poker face, but his eyes revealed a hint of a smile. "But tell me, if you ever want to watch a movie or series, you can let me know."

Tharun's grin widened. "Try me," he said confidently.

Gopal paused momentarily and said, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,". 

Tarun's expression momentarily faltered. "You're right, I don't have it at the moment, but I promise you'll have it by the weekend, my dear friend."

Gopal, intrigued. "How will you manage that? You can't go home for the weekend.". 

"I may not be able to go, but my brother can. He'll bring the movies on a memory card, and I'll sneak it in. A memory card is too small to be caught," Tarun explained, his eyes shining with mischief.

"By the way, I am Gopal Reddy," Gopal said.

"And I am Tarun, just Tarun," Tarun replied with a grin.

Their mischievous journey of adventure unfolded, filled with movie nights and Tarun's knack for breaking the rules, often pulling Gopal along for the wild ride. Gopal, known for his reserved nature, had always struggled to find friends. Well, there was one —a close friend he had in school. But she was a girl.
According to the absurd rules of their school and society, girls and boys were not supposed to be friends. Yet, fate played its hand when they accidentally ended up sitting together in class, as Gopal mistook her for a boy due to her short hair and dress and had a fun time. From that day forward, they defied the unspoken rule, choosing to sit together, despite the whispers and disapproval surrounding them.
But whispers of a forbidden relationship soon tainted their bond. Hurtful rumours spread like wildfire, alleging secret trysts and clandestine kisses behind the school. The girl bore the brunt of the gossip, the weight of judgment crushing her spirit. Gopal later found the culprit behind the rumours and dealt with him in a game of seven stones by throwing the ball onto his head and sending him to the hospital. 

Nevertheless, the damage inflicted cast a shadow that grew darker with time. Tragedy struck when a false rumour emerged, suggesting the girl's accidental mishap of urinating in class resulted from something far more scandalous. It was a burden too heavy to bear, and she made the difficult decision to transfer schools, leaving Gopal bereft and heartbroken. Enter Tarun, who unexpectedly became Gopal's newfound companion. Despite their initial differences, they formed an unlikely friendship as Tarun's carefree and mischievous nature contrasted with Gopal's reserved demeanour.
