In the biblical story of David and Goliath, David, an underdog, defeated Goliath, the Gaint, with nothing but a rock and became king. In contrast, Goliath had a massive Armour, shield, and sword. I don't know whether it happened or it is just a myth. My mathematics teacher taught this biblical story on the first day of my 9th grade. I had no idea I would witness one in my life, and that too in the same year.
