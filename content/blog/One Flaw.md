> I’m Rahul. I'm here to tell you a funny anecdote of my life when I was 13.
> 
Far from the city was my boarding school, with the motto "Character is the highest Virtue ."Wake up, jog, breakfast, school, lunch, sports, prep hour, roll call and sleep. That's how a typical weekday was for a 7th-grade student. 

That day, it was cold and cloudy. After lunch, everyone ran to watch the live news of the Mumbai terrorist attack in the TV Room. I was feeling a bit under the weather. So. I went to my room and took a nap. The nap turned into a deep sleep. I found myself in a forest with my friend. I was starving. After hours of wandering, we found ourselves in front of a huge mango tree. Despite my friend's warning, I threw the rock at a mango in full force. It hit the mango, and the mango fell into nearby thick bushes. Grrrrrrr, my heart skipped a beat after hearing the vicious growl. We ran as fast as we could, tipped over a tree's root, and fell into a bottomless pit. That jolted me awake. I opened my eyes and was startled by Ali standing by my bed with a stern expression on his face.

He said with a grin: "Thank God! You woke up. The only thing that set you apart from the dead was your snore. Do you know that? I now understand why you don't lock your room from inside when you are asleep. What made you wake up, however? How can you sleep like that? I tried to wake you up for the past 5 minutes. But—"

I said sharply: "Stop…Chatterbox and stop grinning. " 

I yawned and said: "I had a horrible nightmare."

Ali said: "What if it becomes true? My mom told me that one should be careful of what they daydream, as it might come true."

I said: "What!—Even if I want to, it's highly impossible." 

Ali said: "You know what, I have some advice for you. If you don't want nightmares in your sleep, keep onions under your bed and sleep. My mom says that." 

I said: "I know that remedy too. But I think it's slippers instead of onions."

Ali said: "No, It's onions. I am 100percent sure of it."

So I said: "Alright, I agree—Leave all that stuff. I thought of having a small nap till the sports class. But soon went into a deep sleep." 

He laughed into his hands and said, "Well, it looks like you have no idea what the time is ."

I glanced at the clock on the table beside the bed and realized I had slept for around 2 hours and missed the sports class. So I had just an hour left for the sports class. 

He laughed:" Go fast, the trainer will be waiting for you on the ground. The last time you were half an hour late, he made you run the field for half an hour, and you were done —This time, you are 2 hours late, hmmm…  you must run on the field for 2 hours then. Can you last for 2 hours? I think you might need an ambulance after an hour. I still have no idea how you are on the junior hockey team ?" 

I drew a deep breath and said: "Neither do I. It's better to skip today and take the punishment tomorrow."
Ali said: "That would be better for you."

"A perfect one. Since it's not your first time, why didn't you keep an alarm to wake up": Ali interrupted. 

"I thought at least one of my three roommates would wake me up before they leave for sports class, it looks like they didn't, or they might have tried, and I didn't wake up…  Wait, wait, what about you, what are you doing here?. Did you also sleep like me" I asked him intriguingly, hoping for him to say yes and feel relieved that I was not alone in this?  

He said with a cheeky smile: "Sorry to disappoint you. I have a school pass till 6 pm today." There were only two ways to go outside of the school. First, You must have a school pass, which will only be issued in the presence of parents or legal guardians. Second, you must be in 12th grade. They are permitted to go out of school as they often have too many competitive exams. 

I said: "Enough facial expressions. I am getting annoyed. How did you get the school pass? Your parents visited you just this Sunday. Did they visit you again today?"

He said: "No. My uncle visited me during lunch. I wanted to have golgappas, so we took a school pass and went outside. I came half an hour back. You know what? You should also try those golgappas. MMMMhhhh, it was tasty, yummy. Pav bhaji was also delicious. The buns were so buttery that they melted in my mouth, and I also had Apple Cake —"

My mouth started watering when I heard the words. Then, I cried: "Enough with the food. I understand. You had awesome food."

I said: "You still didn't answer my question. What are you doing here? I am pretty sure you didn't come all the way here from your little golgappas trip to wake me up and describe to me how good your food was". 

He then paused, his eyes widened, his mouth opened, making a sound aaaaaahhhh, and said," I forgot about that completely"…. 

He looked around for a second to make sure no one heard and sat beside me on the bed. "It looks like our efforts for the past three months will be in the mud. Harish and Shiva have the money needed to buy the iPod. I saw them hiding the money under the cupboard. I don't know how much it was, but I overheard them saying they would buy it from Ravi the evening after the Roll Call. It looks like the offer wasn't only for us. We had competition all along, and they beat us.". 

"Wait, wait, wait—Give a moment to think—You said they hid the money under the cupboard. Are they both still in the room?"

Ali said feebly, "no, they left for sports. But why are you asking?."  

 I said: "Let's go to his room, I mean your room, and check under his cupboard and see how much money they have," 

We found two 500 notes under the cupboard. 
"Why do they have only 1000 here? With this, they can't buy. They need 1500. We have 1410, and still, he said 'no.'": Ali said.

"Are you sure you heard they will buy it this evening?" I asked. Ali nodded yes. 
We concluded they might have hidden the rest of the money somewhere. I was a bit confused why they kept only 1000 under and the rest elsewhere. Suddenly an idea flashed through my brain like lightning. 

"I have an idea. But first, listen to me entirely. OK..": I said 

Ali answered: "OK. Tell me what's in your mind."

I took a deep breath and said nervously: "It's simple. We will steal the money —.

"Whaaaat!—No stealing.No. I can't—It's not I can't, I won't, I won't,": Ali  exclaimed

"Listen first—I told you to listen to me entirely and then speak.": I said.

"Continue,": Ali said

"It's not stealing—We are just borrowing it. We will take this money. We will not use it but keep it with us. We will return it the moment when we buy the iPod.?. Sounds good?." 

He pondered for a minute and said: "Fine with your idea. But, we will be the first suspects when they find out they have lost their money ."

"Don't worry about that. We will hide the money in a place they can't even imagine. Then, if they can't find the money, we are innocent. Even if they find it, what's the proof that it belongs to them? There are no markings on the note. We also have 1410 with us."I said. 

"Serial Numbers—What if they have written the serial numbers just like we did, in case someone stole ours? "Ali said.  

"Ohhhh...That I forgot, let's think." Then, a minute later: "Got it" I shouted.

"Shhhh....Don't shout. We are not doing a good deed. If anyone sees us, we are doomed, OK? So what is it?": Ali said in a low voice. 

"You have a school pass till 6 pm. So, go outside the school and exchange the notes for smaller denominations of 100s or 50s. We are then safe. How does this sound ?": I said 

"Sounds good. But why do I have to go outside the school to exchange notes when I can do that in the school canteen"? Ali asked intriguingly.

"That —It's pretty simple. The 12th graders spend most of their time there. So they can find it suspicious if they see you exchanging notes. OK. To avoid suspicion, I would go back and sleep till all our classmates returned from sports and act as if I was in deep sleep the entire time. You would say that he was with his uncle till evening —See, it's a foolproof plan," I said. 

"OK. But, as we buy an iPod, we will keep the money back. So don't forget that," Ali said. 

We set the plan into motion. We stole the amount, and he went to exchange the notes as planned. I went to my room and lay in my bed. Half an hour later, Ali came back and gave me the money. I asked him nervously, "Why did you come back this early? You should have some after 6 pm to avoid any suspicion. Is all well?".  

He said calmly, "Yes, don't worry. I didn't want to have this large amount in my pocket. I will leave and go to the school library in a few minutes." 

He then gave me the money 980. 

I was intrigued and asked him, "what happened to the rest of the 20". 

He told me, shaking his head, "The canteen guy simply said 'it's not a bank .' So, I bought a donut and a cream roll as well as a cool drink". 

He paused to think and then said slowly, "ahhhhh, I Forgot a honey cake as well." 

I retorted, "You just had Golgappas, Pav bhaji, and an apple cake!—Is everything already in your stomach, or is there some left for me?" Ali said with a smile, "Sorry, there is always a place left for snacks— Where will you hide the money?"

"Yeah, that's the important thing" I examined the entire room for the hiding place. 

"Found it," I said in a low voice enthusiastically. 

"Where?": Ali asked curiously. 

"Mattress,": I said

"Wow, is your brain in your head or leg? Of course, the first thing anyone does is to check under the mattress." Ali said.

"Don't talk —Just watch," I said 

I hid the money. 

"Why can't we buy the iPod tonight? "I asked Ali.

"No, we can't use their money. You said we would hide their money,": Ali said. 

"You forgot. You already did—the snacks which you had earlier. Come on. We will keep it back when we get our pocket money. Please,": I said.

"Ok—Let's buy it tonight,"; Ali said. 

We were so happy, we started dancing and singing in euphoria and ignored the surroundings. Someone entered my room. That's when I realized I had forgotten to lock the door and got a bad feeling that something terrible was about to happen. 

Ali nervously said, "Hello." I was freaking nervous but still kept on a smiley face. 

"Hi, I am Rohan, your 12th-grade senior and School Captain. You must be Ali and You....." Rohan said and moved towards my bed. 

My heart started to beat fast, and I began to clench my teeth. Rohan then started pressing the mattress, my heartbeat increased again, and I felt my heart explode anytime soon. We were standing still without uttering a word. 

He then sat on the bed and said," What happened? Are you guys alright? I won't eat you guys. Don't worry. You can speak freely."I glanced at Ali. 
He was very nervous and frightened, unable to speak a word. I don't know why, but I got an eerie feeling by looking at Rohan.

I sighed silently and said, "Hi, I am Rahul.7th-grade student." 

"You guys must be on the ground right now. What are you doing here?": He asked us. 

"I was feeling a bit under the weather. So I took a nap, but it turned into a deep sleep, and I missed it. And Ali's uncle visited him today. That's why he couldn't." I said. Ali nodded yes. 

 "Ahhh…, wait, are you the same guy, who sits in the first row in the class, yet sleeps and gets caught every time and also you missed many sports periods because of your so-called deep sleep", he said with a pointed look to my face. I had no idea I was so famous in the school that even the school captain knew me. With an embarrassing smile, I answered, "I am the same guy." 

He laughed for a while and said, "Why didn't you sit in the back and sleep? Why sit in the first row?." 

I said:" The teacher made me sit in the first row, as I often got caught sleeping in the back." 

"Ohh... It looks like the teacher’s method to keep you awake in class is not working.": he said. His voice raised abruptly, and he said, "Ok, boys, enough with the pep talk, we have 15 more minutes left. I don't want this to be discussed in front of your classmates. Give me the money back, which you guys stole".

As soon as he said those words, there was pin drop silence in the room. My mind went blank for a second. Then  I looked at Ali. He looked like he would give up at any second with his body sweating in such a cold climate. But, I still had no idea what to do. 

Ali then, with a voice in a shivering way, said:" Bhai, we didn't steal. We just borrowed it from him, and we were about to keep it back after some time.". Rohan was a bit puzzled. He didn't understand a word Ali said. Since Ali had already opened up at that moment, I thought the best way to confront this situation was by being honest.

 I said, "Ravi Bhai from 8th grade offered to sell his iPod for 1500, which costs around 4000. He got it—" 

"Really for 1500… Why is he selling it?" Rohan interrupted bizarrely. 
I said: "He told us he wanted to sell it as he seldom used it and also needed money for his reasons. The offer was only valid for one month." 

Rohan said: "So, you don't know the reason? Well, why would you care if you get an iPod for 1500? Right " 

I nodded yes. 

Rohan said: "Continue the story… I won't interrupt you."

I said:" 1500 was too much for a person to manage in a month. So, I joined hands with Ali.We—"

Rohan interrupted:" If one can, two can...Good… But why only one month? You don't know, right… Continue. Continue. This time I really won't interrupt you."

I said: "We managed 1410 in three weeks. We were short of only 90. We thought of buying it this weekend as we will get some pocket money at the end of this week. But Harish and Shiva collected the money before us. Ali saw them hiding the money under the cupboard. We stole—." 

"We didn't steal it. We borrowed it to buy the iPod, and then later this weekend, when we got our pocket money, we thought to keep 1000 back where it was," Ali interrupted. 
Rohan's face was still puzzled. 
"Ohhh, you guys borrowed with their permission?." We nodded no. 

" Looks like the word borrow has a different meaning in your dictionary. You idiots, it's called stealing, not borrowing. It's still unclear, and I still have questions. So, We will wait for those two guys. In the meanwhile, please give me the money which you so-called borrowed from them.": He said annoyingly. 

The corner of my lips moved a bit, forming a smile, and I pointed my finger at the bed. He bent down and looked under the bed; there was nothing but a broom. I said slowly, "In the Mattress." He got up and examined under the mattress but found nothing. 

He then stared at me with his eyes widening and said," Don't play with me… I am losing my patience. Give me the money". 

I said, "It's in the mattress, "I already said. ". 

He looked at me skeptically, sat on the chair next to the bed, and said: "Bring me the money from wherever you have hidden." 

I removed the money from the small cut in the mattress. He patted my shoulders and said," Wow, an excellent place to hide money. You guys are on the next level. One hides under the cupboard, not in but under, and the other in the mattress". 

He was pretty impressed with us. I gave him the money. It was 980, but he didn't question us as we had stolen 1000." Maybe Ali got caught in the canteen, but how did he know? Shiva and Harish were in sports as he said, 'we will wait for them. That means they didn't complain, nor did they know. Ali didn't tell him, or Did he?" I thought, then I glanced at Ali. 

Tears started rolling off Ali's eyes, and he began to cry. Seeing Ali, I also joined him but without tears. It was impossible to get tears on command. I thought, "How do these actors in movies manage ?". 

Rohan looked at his watch and said, "Both of you, stop crying. It's almost time for your classmates to come back from sports. You don't want everyone to know what is happening here, right—If you continue crying, then I might have to explain the situation. 

"Hearing this, Ali wiped his tears and stopped crying. 

I also dropped my act. Rohan told us to keep silent and not utter a single word unless and until he said it. We looked at each other for the next few minutes in silence. It felt like an eternity in hell. I felt guilty as I was the root cause of this mishap. Ali's face was hilarious with his eyes red in color, and whenever he breathed in and out, snot came in and out. It was disgusting, and I told him to clean his nose by actions as we are not allowed to speak. He then picked his nose with his finger and rubbed the snot on his shorts. "It's more disgusting now. Maybe I shouldn't have said that to him, "I thought.  

Later, everyone came back from sports. Rohan asked my roommates to leave the room for the next 20 minutes and asked one of them to call Harish and Shiva to my room. A minute later, Harish and Shiva came in with smiles. 

With a smile, Rohan said, "Hi, I am Rohan, a 12-grade student, and You guys must be—". 

Shiva and Harish introduced themselves. 
"That's enough for the introduction, and now I will come to the point." 
He took 1000 in his hand. The notes might have looked familiar as the smile on their faces faded away. 
"They have told me everything and gave me this money. I would like to know what happened. I promise you it will stay within these four walls. Don't worry about these two(Rahul and Ali). They aren't innocent either— Better tell the truth". He glowered at them.    

"It's quite simple. They just stole from someone else. But, wait…Did they steal from Rohan?… Stealing from someone who stole from someone else—I don't think it's a bad thing," I thought. 

A minute later, Shiva, with his arms crossed and downward gaze, said, "We wanted to buy an iPod, but we could manage only 500. Today morning, Akhil, a 6th-grade student —"

"I know, I know him.": Rohan interrupted. 

"I was passing by his room and saw him keeping 1000 in his cupboard. He went for a bath, and his room was empty. He didn't lock his cupboard either. So, I took the money and later hid it under my cupboard with the help of Harish. But, We didn't steal exactly, we just took the money, and we seriously meant to give it back a month later.": said, Shiva 

"It's called Stealing—you idiots," Rohan shouted. "Wow— and then these gems stole from you. Wow, superb— I don't know how to describe this situation…." Rohan said.
Shiva and Harish's eyes were wide open in shock, they looked at each other, and then quickly, they turned their heads in unison at us and gave a pointed, angry look at us with teeth clenched. Then, with a cheeky smile, Ali said, "We are sorry, guys. We also had the same idea. We meant to give the money back —". 
"In a week, not a month," I interrupted enthusiastically. 
Rohan burst into a big laugh. 

Rohan, in a sarcastic way, said, "Wow…a group led by Rahul so-called, borrowed the money from the group led by Shiva so-called, borrowed the money from a simple guy Akhil to buy an iPod for 1500, now this is where I am curious—Hmmm". 

He went silent for a minute and then asked Shiva to call Ravi. 

I wondered, "what if Rohan buys the iPod from Ravi?"  "Even if he did, I can't stop him, given our predicament. Who can resist themselves from buying an iPod for 1500?" I thought. 

A minute later, Ravi came. After a pleasant introduction, Rohan yawned and said, "Do you have the iPod with you, which you are selling to these guys?".

Ravi looked at us, trying to grasp the situation he was in. Rohan then continued," Don't look at them. They told me you are selling the iPod for 1500. I wanted to buy an iPod. I thought about buying it from you. I even bought the money". 

My hunch came true. He wanted to buy it from him. I felt slightly disappointed, and It looked like I wasn't alone by seeing the other guy's faces. Ravi smiled and said: "AAhhh, that one. I will bring it in a minute". With his gaze fixed on us, Rohan said:" How are you guys feeling ….good or bad?.". We all quickly nodded from left to right in unison, implying no. Finally, with eyes popping out, Rohan said, "Good then." 

Ravi entered the room with iPod in his hand. Rohan took the iPod, carefully skimmed it, and asked, "Where did you buy it?"

Ravi said," I got it as a birthday gift from my cousin."

Rohan asked, "OK…Where did he buy it?". 

Ravi paused for a second and said, "Hmmm…Somewhere in Ludhiana." 

A second later, Rohan burst into hysterical laughter again for a whole minute.

Rohan said, "This must be the craziest day of my life. One group steals money—" He had a narrow gaze at us.

"OK, OK, one group led by Rahul, so-called borrowed money from another group led by Shiva, so-called borrowed money from simple guy Akhil, to do what?— To buy an iPod, and now here comes the biggest twist. You were selling me an iPod, which belongs to me. This became Hera pheri. What the hell is happening? OHHHh—GOd—" We were stunned. He started laughing again. Ravi was lost for words… He stammered, "no …, no Bhai. I-I got it as a birthday gift from— from my cousin." 

Rohan gave a severe pointed look and his typical warning, "See, I don't want this Hera Pheri to spread. It's crazy, I know,  but be honest, think and answer. OK. If not, I will officially complain to the school, and they will find out whether you got it as a birthday gift or not. But I am pretty sure this one is stolen." 

Ravi asked, "Do you have any proof,  Rohan Bhai?". 

Rohan said with a grin, "First, it's not for sale in India, and second I have the bill in my room, and third, there is a small scratch under the iPod. If you want, I can show you the bill—  Do you know Jasbir Bhai, my senior who graduated this year ?". 

Ravi nodded yes. "I lent it to him a month before he graduated. He later told me he lost it somewhere and just paid me. So here it was all along" Ravi was silent with no words coming out of his mouth. Ravi then just left the room in silence and didn't come back. 

Rohan glanced at Ali and said, "Thanks. If not for your school uniform in the canteen, I wouldn't have gotten my iPod back, nor would I have found Akhil's money." 
I looked at Ali. He was wearing a school uniform." Ahhh... That was the flaw in the plan. So that's how we got caught.": I thought. 

A few minutes later, everyone left, and the incident never came to light.
