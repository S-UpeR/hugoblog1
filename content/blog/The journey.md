#### Chapter 1: _Silent Flames_

Struggling to fall asleep, he cautiously unzipped the tent, careful not to disturb his sleeping companions and stepped outside. Extending his arms in a stretch, he meandered aimlessly before settling on a split rail fence facing the shimmering beach. The cool sea breeze kissed his skin, sending pleasant shivers down his spine. Still, he remained oblivious to the chill, with his gaze fixed on the mesmerizing glow emanating from the sea. The rhythmic symphony of crashing waves filled his ears with a melodic lullaby that beckoned him into a realm of deep contemplation. 

Startled by the gentle pat on his shoulder, he swiftly turned his head and, to his surprise, discovered his aunt standing there. She had ventured out of the tent, searching for him, her concerned gaze meeting his.

"Ai view ta amazing re, kintu late ta thoda bahut nahi?" she said, yawning. "Almost 12 am hoichhi, aau ete thanda bhi," she added.
"Yeah, it's late," he responded with a dull voice, "let's head back and catch some sleep." As he prepared to return to the tent, his aunt's gaze turned towards the sky, where the stars twinkled like lanterns, casting a gentle glow across the velvety darkness. It was a mesmerizing sight. Turning to him, she suggested, "Ai fire ta jwaliba, ei ama good view re mote kichi samaya pain au bharijau."

With a perplexed expression, he responded, "I'm sorry, I don't understand."
"But you understood me earlier when I spoke in Odia," his aunt replied.
"Ah, before, I just got the gist of it as you ... mixed some English and Hindi words. You told me that even though the scenery is beautiful, I should go back and sleep because it's already 12 o'clock and cold." "Here, I thought you understood, Odiya...It's fine... I was just saying, Let's light a fire and enjoy this beautiful view for a little longer". 
He exclaimed with a light-hearted tone, finally grasping her words.
"Hmmm, let's make a fire," he said, contemplating the idea.
She looked around and suggested, "Let's make it near the beach. What do you think?"
"Let's do it," he agreed. 

They built a fire and settled down, its warm glow enveloping them. Once again, he found himself lost in his thoughts, almost as if in a trance. Breaking the silence, she said, "Last time I saw you in your college with Sarika, you were a completely different person."
"Different... how?" he inquired, his curiosity piqued.
"You were goofy and funny back then, always doing things that pleased you without worrying too much about others," she explained.
"And now?" he questioned, his voice tinged with melancholy.
"Now, you seem moody and sulky," she replied honestly.
A faint smile played upon his lips, but his eyes betrayed a hint of sadness. "Or... you weren't really interested in this trip, and Sarika convinced you to come along," she said, her gaze shifting towards the tent. "I can't blame her if she did... That's just who she is...," she added affectionately.

"No, no... your lovely daughter didn't force me," he replied. "I was actually happy when she invited me on this trip," he added.
"But your actions show me otherwise," she countered. "Yesterday, you didn't even step inside the Jagannath Mandira, and today, you seem lost in your own world. You've barely spoken more than 10 words in the past two days. What's going on? What is holding you back from being yourself?"
He remained silent, unable to find the words to express his inner turmoil. Everything she said resonated with the truth he had been avoiding.
"Whatever it is keeping you from being yourself, either speak it out or..." she trailed off. He kept his silence, his gaze fixed on the flickering flames of the fire. Then, slowly shifting his gaze towards her, he uttered, "I would like to tell a story."
With a deep breath, he directed his gaze towards the mesmerizing dance of the crackling fire and began weaving the tale.
