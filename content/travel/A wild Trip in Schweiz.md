So my dear friend moved to Zurich and invited me to visit for a week. Despite Switzerland being notoriously expensive, I figured it was worth it for the chance to explore some beautiful scenery and spend time with my pal. So we tackled a 120km bike ride from Interlaken to Meringen to Grindelwald for two days.
Let me tell you, the weather gods were not on our side. We spent half the day pedaling through rain and wind and the other half pushing our bikes uphill for 20km because we were too cheap to rent proper mountain bikes. When we finally reached the top, we couldn't find a place to camp, so we slept in a cow barn with our new bovine friends.
The next day we rode downhill, which was a welcome relief until we realized we had nowhere to sleep again. So we pitched a tent near some waterfalls in Lauterbrunnen, which sounded romantic until we woke up with our tent soaked through.
After a few more days of biking around Zurich, including a 50km solo ride on a bike better suited for a grandma's Sunday stroll than steep hills, I decided to roam the city and buy some expensive chocolates to ease the pain of my sore legs.
Overall, it was a delightful trip filled with cheap thrills and questionable decision-making. However, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience the joys of traveling on a budget. Just be prepared to sleep in a barn or two, and bring a bike that can handle the mountains.

>As my train chugged back into Zurich, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. I had biked my way through Switzerland on a shoestring budget, slept in a cow barn, and eaten more chocolate than any human should reasonably consume. But despite the challenges, I had made it out alive, with memories that would last a lifetime.
And as I limped off the train with sore thighs and a significantly lighter wallet than when I arrived, I couldn't help but smile. After all, what's the point of traveling if you come back intact, exhausted, and with a newfound appreciation for the simple things in life (like a comfortable bed and a non-Klapprad bike)?
