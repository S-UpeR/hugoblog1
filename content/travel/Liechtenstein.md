Well, well, well, my grand plan for a three-day trip to Switzerland and Liechtenstein went straight out the window when I missed my train on the first day. Not to worry, my buddy and I still managed to have a blast checking out Buchs and roaming around Liechtenstein. But then we had our sights set on exploring the Boden Sea, only to find it a bit lackluster and end up getting lost in Bezau instead. Thank goodness for the local cops! On the final day, we just kept things simple and explored more of Liechtenstein and Austria because, let's face it, planning is overrated anyway.
