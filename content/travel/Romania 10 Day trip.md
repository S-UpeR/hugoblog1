Please have some patience, my very few readers... Will be available in a few days.

>In Germany, people use ICE or IC trains for long-distance travel and Regional Trains(RE, RB) for journeys within states. The ICE trains are high-speed and have very few stops. If one book an ICE ticket in advance, it's cheaper(around 15€-30€); if not, it is costly(80€-120€). Regional Train ticket prices never change with time and are more affordable. If traveling in groups, they are much cheaper. One can also use regional trains for long-distance travel, but at the expense of long traveling hours and switching more than two trains. Regional trains connect other countries too.
