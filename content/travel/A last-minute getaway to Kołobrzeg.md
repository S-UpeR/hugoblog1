Travel is a way to destress oneself. It helps you to take your mind off stressful situations. My friend was going through a bad phase. So, We decided to go on a short trip of 3 days the next day. An hour later, another one joined us, and two became three.

Now, we had to choose the destination of our travel. We three had our conditions. One wanted to see the Sunset on a beach. The other wanted to do some sport. I wanted to visit a small city in another country and the last important thing; our budget should not exceed 100€.

>In Germany, people use ICE or IC trains for long-distance travel and Regional Trains(RE, RB) for journeys within states. The ICE trains are high-speed and have very few stops. If one book an ICE ticket in advance, it's cheaper(around 15€-30€); if not, it is costly(80€-120€). Regional Train ticket prices never change with time and are more affordable. If traveling in groups, they are much cheaper. One can also use regional trains for long-distance travel, but at the expense of long traveling hours and switching more than two trains. Regional trains connect other countries too.

Germany introduced a 9€ ticket for three months(Jun-Aug) to encourage people to use public transport and to act as relief for rising fuel prices. With this ticket, one can use all public transport for free, except for ICE trains. Till now, I have stepped foot in all neighboring German countries except Switzerland and Poland. We chose Poland as I had big plans for Switzerland later this September, and the cost of living in Poland is cheaper. So we decided to travel to Szczecin, Poland, a border city on the banks of the Oder River in Northwest Poland, after a glance at the regional train network of Germany.

We made the plan. A train ride till Szczecin, bike to a nearby beach for the Sunset, and then — go with the flow. That's it. Neither did we check how far the nearest beach was, nor had we booked accommodation for the night. We just decided to make it an adventure trip. As for the currency in Poland, we had a credit card.

The following day our journey started. We reached the station with our bikes half an hour before. The platform was unusually crowded due to the 9€ ticket and Pfingsten Holidays. We boarded the train with our bikes and found no place to sit. However, it was just the start. We got down at Magdeburg two hours later to switch trains to Berlin. The platform was empty. We were happy, but the happiness didn't stay long. With time, it was also crowded. Half an hour later, the train arrived on the platform. People rushed onto the train, pushing one another to find seats. The scenario reminded me of the Bombay local train. I never thought I would see one like that in Germany.

We barely managed to get in with our cycles. On the opposite side of the platform, a train to Leipzig stood. It was empty. Seeing it, we pondered, changing our destination to Leipzig. But we wanted to see the Sunset on the beach, and there was no beach in Leipzig. So, we carried on on our journey. The trip to Berlin took about 3 hours, and it was uncomfortable. It was a standing journey. We had no place to move as the train was overcrowded. The train stopped at later stations only for the people to get down. The train conductor had a rough time as he stopped people from getting in to avoid overloading the train.

We were lucky to get on the train with bikes. During this trip, I saw two sisters sitting on top of each other on the train. It was cute. They were exchanging their positions every 10 minutes along the route. Later in the evening, my friend told me some guys were trying to take indecent pictures of these girls when they removed their tops. Then, they put on the tops again. I felt sad. Finally, we got down in Berlin and switched trains to Angermünde. From there on, the trains were a bit empty. We found places to sit. Later, We changed trains to Szczecin. After seven tiresome hours, we reached our destination at 3 pm.

We were hungry. But first, we looked for a nearby beach on the map. The nearest one was around 100 km away. However, even though we planned to cycle for 100km, we still needed a state. So we decided to change our destination and travel by train. We glanced at the railway network in Poland and found a city on the Baltic Sea, Kołobrzeg. We cross-checked with google maps and found a direct train from Szczecin. We were glad. We went to Ticket Automat to buy tickets, but unfortunately, it didn't work. So, We went to the Ticket counter to book the ticket. Sadly, the person at the counter didn't know English, nor could we Polish. So, we came back without buying anything. A minute later, we returned and used the Google Translator app to converse with her. Luckily, she understood what we wanted, as sometimes the Translator can misinterpret. The situation was hilarious. We successfully booked tickets for the 6 pm train.

Now, we had to put something in our stomachs to kill hunger. We rode on our bikes to find a nearby Imbiss and have Döner or Durum. We found one after a few minutes. But there were only beef options. We roamed for more but couldn't find an Imbiss with Chicken Döner or Durum. In the end, we went to KFC as we were sure to find some chicken there. We had massive lunch in KFC for just 6 euros per person. It was my first KFC in Europe. We then rode around the city on our bikes for the rest. We saw the Szczecin Cathedral, Szczecin Philharmonic Hall, and the city's riverfront, and it was beautiful. Szczecin had bike paths for most of the town. But in certain parts of the city, the cycle routes end abruptly without signs, primarily due to construction. That was a bit of a hassle, and the cycle route along the river was quite a ride. The city has trams and buses as its public transport. We visited a supermarket before boarding our train and bought snacks and drinks. The one thing I do during my visits to new countries is visiting a supermarket to see what they offer.

We came back to the station and boarded the train with our bikes. The train was empty. We parked our bikes and sat in the nearby open saloon with a table seat. A few minutes later, the train was also crowded. But still, we had a place to sit. I sat on the window seat and enjoyed the view as the train moved. Little later, our bikes fell as a woman moved our bikes from the parking place and sat there. A girl tried to help us in keeping our cycles back. But the woman had no response. We had no interest in arguing with her as we were tired. I was annoyed, but I tried to keep calm. She looked at us as if we were at fault.

An hour later, the train started to empty. A seat beside me was empty. The woman who annoyed me sat beside me. She smelled tobacco. She tried to converse with us in Polish. We nodded and told her that we couldn't speak Polish. Then she talked with us in English. It wasn't proper, but we understood what she meant. She conversed with us about her future vacations. She also showed us Marijuana. At first, I thought, "She might be trying to sell us Marijuana." Later she showed us the bill. She bought it from a medical shop and suggested where we could buy it. I had no interest in Marijuana and, later on, slept for the rest of the journey. My friends woke me up when the train reached Kołobrzeg. The trip took around two and a half hours. We arrived there by 8.30 pm. We still had half an hour left for the Sunset.

The beach was 2 km away. So we rode on our bikes and looked around for a perfect spot. Finally, we found Kołobrzeg Pier as our spot for the Sunset. So many people were waiting for the sun to set. The weather was perfect, and the skies were clear. We remembered we had no accommodation for the night. I searched for a place on Airbnb, but most homes cost around 100€ per night. I then searched on Booking.com. I found a cheap place for around 42€ for three people a night. It fit our budget but was about 8km from the pier. But we didn't care, as we had our bikes with us. We booked it.

Meanwhile, the sun started to set. The view justified all our tiresome travel. All the tiredness vanished in a moment. I took some time-lapse with my drone, and we enjoyed the twilight. We spent some time taking photographs and had some fun. Unfortunately, we didn't see the check-in time even though we had booked our accommodation. It was 8 pm. I only saw it after I had a glance at my email later. We were already late by 2 hours. We called them to request a late check-in, even though they didn't speak English, but fortunately, they spoke Deutsch. They accepted late check-in but only till 10.30 pm. We had only half an hour left. We got on our bikes, rode as fast as possible, and reached there in 20 minutes. The hotel was managed by a couple who were sweet. We later discovered that we were the only people staying in the hotel. We didn't have an ounce of energy left in our bodies. We had a hot bath and took a deep sleep. We had a chaotic day, but the end was worth all the chaos. 

{{< image src="images/poland/dji3.jpg" caption="Three Idiots" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

Our room had a balcony and a beach nearby. The next day around 9 pm, We had some tea and started our day. First, we visited the nearby beach. The water was cold. So, we abandoned our thoughts of having a bath. Next, we looked around to have breakfast but needed help finding an open restaurant nearby. Well, we again had fast food, but at MCd as brunch. It was a shame to have fast food as breakfast. We had no other options. We then went to the railway station to book our return ticket to Szczecin the next day. Two female border police came to us and asked for our passports. We showed them our passports, and they started questioning us. We needed to understand their questions, as they only spoke in Polish, Deutsch, or English. We tried using Google Translate, but this time it was misinterpreted. They also understood that. I was excited that they might take us to a nearby police station. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. They brought papers in English stating they needed our consent and weren't doing any unlawful work. We gladly signed it, and they left.

We roamed around the city. Kołobrzeg was a port city in northwestern Poland on the coast of the Baltic Sea with a population of around 50,000. We visited the lighthouse at the entrance to the port. Under the lighthouse was a mineral rock museum, which we didn't visit. The port was charming and had two breakwaters on either side, the eastern and the western. We had a walk on the east breakwater. It was peaceful and relaxing. We sat there for some time and observed all the small ships and boats passing.

Finally, one of us wanted a boat ride, and we said yes, why not? There were many boats with different themes, and we went on a ship with a pirate theme. It was 42plz per person. We requested the person at the counter some Polish currency. For my travel, I use credit cards instead of cash. We wanted to have some Polish currency as souvenirs. He gave us, as we bought three tickets from him. We don't want to exchange currency, as I was scammed once in Prague.

The ride took us a bit far into the sea. We sat on the ship's bow as the ride went on, and I saw a girl and her small brother on the boat. They were holding hands and sat beside us. Her smile was beautiful. The ride was for around an hour.

The following itinerary for our trip was to go for a small cycle tour. It was the only planned thing on our journey. But it didn't go the way we planned. Initially, we thought of 50kms, but it was already 2 pm. So, we reduced it to 26 km. The first half of the ride was along the sea beach, which was terrific. We even made a video of it. We passed through a parade of old Polish cars playing loud music along the way. One of the cars had a Pornhub casting sticker on it. That was funny.

We stopped at an eco-park with swamps. The beach was the only thing separating the eco-park and the sea. The beach also had many wooden groynes along the coast. We stood on one of the groynes, flew my drone, and made some hyper lapses and 360 photographs. Our ride resumed after a small break. We passed through a small airfield with a charter plane on it. We thought of trespassing, but one of us reminded us that we were foreigners in a foreign land. After that, we gave up our stupidity and carried on. The second half of the ride was bumpy and wild. We rode through farms, a village, then onto a highway, and later back into the city. We were tired and wanted to have a bite.

We returned to the Innenstadt and found a Kebabhaus with a huge line outside. We thought it might be delicious, seeing the line. So we gave it a try. Some Southeast Asian guys managed the Kebabhaus. At first, we thought we might have to adjust for Falafel(a chickpea doner) due to our experience in Szczecin, but fortunately, they had Chicken Doner. They made us tasty and spicy Doner kebab, the best we had till now. It was cheap, just 15plz, i.e., around 3 euros. We spent the rest of the day wandering the beach and returned to our accommodation by 8 pm. We had some tea for the night and slept. That was the only day without chaos.

The following day, we boarded our train back. Unfortunately, the ride back home was also chaotic. We took a different route to avoid crowded trains in Germany, but luck wasn't on our side. On our way back, some trains didn't allow bikes on board. A funny incident happened on the way back. We boarded a crowded train with our bikes in Germany. A minute later, the conductor came and asked us to get out. We got out and saw that a guy with a bike who could not get in with his cycle complained to the conductor. But the funny thing was, a few minutes later, he took a train in the opposite direction. I didn't understand why the hell did he complain. I faced scenarios like this in India but never expected these incidents in Germany. This travel made me realize when push comes to shove; everyone's the same, be it an Indian or a German. After nine tiresome and chaotic hours, we returned, and our expenses for the entire trip were 90€. I liked this trip; it was fun, frustrating, and exciting.
