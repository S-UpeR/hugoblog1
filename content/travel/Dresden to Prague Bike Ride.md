I travel to see beautiful landscapes, try incredible meals, meet new people, and widen my horizons. But, of course, the best way to do that is on a bike. It makes my travel more adventurous. During my first bike tour, We stayed at Airbnb and hostels for the night after the ride every day. For the second in Sweden and the third in Switzerland, we did wild camping in a tent for the nights. But this time, we decided to move away from the tent. The tent, which we have, is around 3-4 kilos, which is a bit heavy and takes up too much space on the bike. So, we decided to do away with the tent and instead use a hammock, which only takes up a little space and weighs less than half a kilo. The funniest thing is that we didn't get to use the hammocks we had along the trip. I bought a new hammock for this trip, which still needs to be opened.

It's been around six months since I went on a bike ride. My last bike ride of more than 20 km was last September in Switzerland. That was one hell of a ride. So, when my roommate asked me whether I would like to join his bike trip at the beginning of April ?. I said yes, without giving it much thought. Even though I had planned a week trip to Romania from March 29th to April 5th, I still couldn't say no. Now the question came, Where and also when ??.  He wanted to ride along the Elbe route from Magdeburg to Dresden. I visited Prague for the first time in August 2021. I traveled to Prague from Dresden on a train along the Elbe River. It was a splendid route along the banks of the river between the mountains. Then I thought, I will ride the way again but with a bike to enjoy the view. Alas, the chance came. So, I said, " How about Dresden to Prague?" Then I showed him some pics to make him change his mind. It did work out differently. He said, "How about Magdeburg to Prague, a total of around 500kms?". It would take around nine days, and I was only interested in Dresden to Prague, about 220km. Usually, one can complete the ride in 160km. But we wanted to ride along the Elbe and visit some Czech cities on the banks of the river, so 220km. After some time, we agreed. He will start his journey from Magdeburg, and I will join him in Dresden. It was good for me.

I packed my bike with all the gear, supplies, food, water, and clothes.
And I started my journey on the IC train to Dresden with my bike on Saturday. I reached Dresden around noon and met with my roomie, who had already ridden for around 230kms. We first toured Dresden, the capital city of Saxony in Germany, on the banks of Elbe. The view of Dresden across the river Elbe is a sight to behold. We walked through the Easter market near the train station(Hauptbahnhof) to the old town(Innere Innenstadt). The Innere Innenstadt has magnificent architecture featuring Frauenkirche(a Lutheran Baroque Church), Fürstenzug( A mural of a mounted procession of the rulers of Saxony.), Dresdner Residenzschloss, Semperoper Dresden, and the Zwinger Palace. The unfortunate thing about Dresden is that the Allied forces controversially destroyed most of the old town during world war two, and later, Dresden was rebuilt twice. The first reconstruction was immediately after the war, and the second was after the German reunification to restore Dresden to its former glory.

We loaded ourselves with lunch at a kebab restaurant(damn tasty, anything tastes good if one is hungry!) and started our bike adventure ride to Prague. Unfortunately, the weather on the first day was a bit colder and windy than expected. So, I had to gear up myself with thermals against the cold weather. Nevertheless, the bike ride was pretty beautiful along the river bank. We rode for around 35 km on the first day. The first twenty km takes you to Pirna, mainly through a meadow, following good bike paths and scenic riverside trails through vineyards and fields.

The Elbe River from Dresden to Prague flows in between mountains. The Railway line from Dresden to Prague traverses along the cycle route, sandwiched between the river bank and the mountain. After 35 km, we found a place under the hill to sleep.  There is a disadvantage when one goes on a bike ride a proper cycle route. You will find few places to camp or sleep. Luckily we found a small hut belonging to someone who uses it to store their firewood under the hill to crash for the night. We just hoped no one would come banging late at night and tell us to move out. Fortunately, no one did. It was 5.30 pm. We unpacked ourselves, had a light snack, and cleaned the place a bit. We can't sleep in the daylight.


>It's illegal in Germany and the Czech to go wild camping. But, still, many do. If you set up camp at dusk, leave at dawn, make no fire, don't illuminate with LED lights, no loud music, leave no trace, and and if one keep's their distance from roads and animal trails, one should be fine. The worst thing that could happen is someone asking you to pack up and leave.

The following day, we boarded our train back. Unfortunately, the ride back home was also chaotic. We took a different route to avoid crowded trains in Germany, but luck wasn't on our side. On our way back, some trains didn't allow bikes on board. A funny incident happened on the way back. We boarded a crowded train with our bikes in Germany. A minute later, the conductor came and asked us to get out. We got out and saw that a guy with a bike who could not get in with his cycle complained to the conductor. But the funny thing was, a few minutes later, he took a train in the opposite direction. I didn't understand why the hell did he complain. I faced scenarios like this in India but never expected these incidents in Germany. This travel made me realize when push comes to the shove; everyone's the same, be it an Indian or a German. After nine tiresome and chaotic hours, we made it back, and our expenses for the entire trip were 90€. I liked this trip, as it was fun, frustrating, and exciting.  


>Our last minute getaway to Kołobrzeg was fun, chaotic, exciting and cheap.
