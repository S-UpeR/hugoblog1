I travel to see beautiful landscapes, try incredible meals and new things, meet new people, and widen my horizons. But, of course, the best way to do that is on a bike. It makes my travel more adventurous. During my first bike tour, We stayed at Airbnb and hostels for the night after the ride every day. For the second in Sweden and the third in Switzerland, we did wild camping in a tent for the nights. But this time, we decided to move away from the tent.
>It's illegal in Germany and the Czech to go wild camping. But, still, many do. If you set up camp at dusk, leave at dawn, make no fire, don't illuminate with LED lights, no loud music, leave no trace, and keep your distance from roads, hunters, and animal trails, one should be fine. The worst thing that could happen is someone asking you to pack up and leave at dusk or dawn.

The tent, which we have, is around 3-4 kilos, which is a bit heavy and takes up too much space on the bike. So, we decided to do away with the tent and instead use a hammock, which only takes up a little space and weighs less than half a kilo. The funniest thing is that we didn't get to use the hammocks we had along the trip.

It's been around six months since I went on a bike ride. My last bike ride of more than 20 km was last September in Switzerland. That was one hell of a ride. So, when my roommate asked me whether I would like to join his bike trip at the beginning of April ?. I said yes, without giving it much thought. Even though I had planned a week trip to Romania from March 29th to April 5th, I still couldn't say no. Now the question came, Where and also when ??.  He wanted to ride along the Elbe route from Magdeburg to Dresden. I visited Prague for the first time in August 2021. I traveled to Prague from Dresden on a train along the Elbe River. It was a splendid route along the banks of the river between the mountains. Then I thought, I will ride the way again but with a bike to enjoy the view. Alas, the chance came. So, I said, "How about Dresden to Prague?" Then I showed him some pics to make him change his mind. It did work out differently. He said, "How about Magdeburg to Prague, a total of around 500kms?". It would take around nine days, and I was only interested in Dresden to Prague, about 220km. Usually, one can complete the ride in 160km. But we wanted to ride along the Elbe and visit some Czech cities on the banks of the river, so 220km. After some time, we agreed. He will start his journey from Magdeburg, and I will join him in Dresden. It was good for me. I set a budget of 100€ for this trip.

>My roomie rides a Liegerad bike, also known as recumbent bike, a bike where the rider sits in reclined position with their feet positioned forward. Due to their unique design, it takes time to get used to, as we are more accustomed to traditional bikes. They are expensive, as they are not available as tradtional bikes. Even i am not accustomed to the Liegerad yet. 

Day 1: 08.04.2023(35km):    I packed my bike with all the gear, supplies, food, water, and clothes. 
And I started my journey on the IC train to Dresden with my bike on Saturday. I reached Dresden around noon and met with my roomie, who had already ridden for around 230kms. We first toured Dresden, the capital city of Saxony in Germany, on the banks of Elbe. The view of Dresden across the river Elbe is a sight to behold. We walked through the Easter market near the train station(Hauptbahnhof) to the old town(Innere Innenstadt). The Innere Innenstadt has magnificent architecture featuring Frauenkirche(a Lutheran Baroque Church), Fürstenzug( A mural of a mounted procession of the rulers of Saxony.), Dresdner Residenzschloss, Semperoper Dresden, and the Zwinger Palace. The unfortunate thing about Dresden is that the Allied forces controversially destroyed most of the old town during World War Two. Later, Dresden was rebuilt twice. The first reconstruction was immediately after the war, and the second was after the German reunification to restore Dresden to its former glory.

We loaded ourselves with lunch at a kebab restaurant(damn tasty, anything tastes good if one is hungry!) and started our bike adventure ride to Prague. Unfortunately, the weather on the first day was a bit colder and windy than expected. So, I had to gear up myself with thermals against the cold weather. Nevertheless, the bike ride was pretty beautiful along the river bank. We rode for around 35 km on the first day. The first twenty km takes you to Pirna, mainly through a meadow, following good bike paths and scenic riverside trails through vineyards and fields.

The Elbe River from Dresden to Prague flows in between mountains. The Railway line from Dresden to Prague traverses along the cycle route, sandwiched between the river bank and the mountain. After 35 km, we found a place under the hill to sleep near Stadt Wehlen. But there was a disadvantage to this bike route. There were very few places to camp, as the path lies under the mountain most of the way and the river bank on the other. Luckily we found a small open hut belonging to someone who uses it to store their firewood under the hill to crash for the night. It was 5.30 pm. We unpacked ourselves, had a light snack, and cleaned the place a bit. We can't sleep in the daytime, as someone can see us. The sunset was around 8 pm. I can only use my mobile sometimes, as we are short on power banks. I only had one power bank of 10000 mah, which I needed for the next three days. My roomie asked me to join him on a trek to the top of the mountain above us. It was exhausting, as there was no trail and too much gradient. While descending, I lost my foot, and I slipped down. Fortunately, I wasn't hurt, as the leaves covered the hill completely.

Later, we opened our cooking equipment and had noodles and tea for the equipment. The sun had set by then. We covered the open sides with the rain Tarp of the Hammock to ensure no one could see us and slept in our sleeping bags for the night

>Cooking Equipment: Spiritus, Burner, a small metal bowl, and some cutlery . Sleeping Equipment: Hammock and Rain Tarp, Sleeping Bag, Sleeping pad .

Day 2: 09.04.2023(90km Ride):   The next day, the weather was slightly better(Sunny, yet cold). So, after breakfast(cereals with milk) and tea, we set on our second day of the ride. After a few km ride, we entered the Sächsische Schweiz territory. We had a break in Königstein to have a hot chocolate drink and freshen up for the day. In Königstein is Königstein Fortress(Festung Königstein), perched high on a sandstone plateau, which I visited a while back. It offers a stunning panoramic view of the Elbe River valley, with its sandstone cliffs and river meanders. But it takes at least 5-6 hours. So, we dropped the idea and rode through Bad Schandau(a spa town nestled in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains.) This route section had stunning views of sandstone cliffs and rock formations. Finally, we reached the border, and we rode through the border for around 4 km, as the border was along the river. Finally, after a ride of 35 km from Stadt Wehlen, we reached Děčín(a city in the northern part of the Czech Republic).

{{< image src="images/praguebike/5.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

We crossed the bridge(Tyršův most) and rode into the city, had a view of the Děčín Castle, located on a hill overlooking the town. The city center of Děčín has charming architecture, including historic buildings, churches, and squares. From that side, we saw many people climbing Shepherd's Wall via Ferrata on the other side of the river. So, naturally, I wanted to do it. But, due to time constraints, I put it on my bucket list for the future.

{{< image src="images/praguebike/c3.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

After that, we rode through industrial areas along the bank of the river to Ústí nad Labem, an industrial city on the banks of the Elbe River. By 4 pm, we were in the town. We strolled through the city, visited a supermarket, refilled our supplies, and stopped by a cafe to have a coffee and charge our phones. Now, it's time to find a place to crash for the night, if not a good spot for our hammock. We rode for around 20 km; we found a small locked house with a small garden on the outskirts of Libochovany, a small village. We searched around the house, but no one was there. It was perfect for us to crash for the night. We already rode for around 90km. I was done for the day. So, We unpacked, had dinner, and slept in our sleeping bags under the side of the roof. Our day two ride was pretty much smooth.

Most of the road was paved, and only some parts of the ride were unpaved. Along the way, I saw many people riding kick bikes; it was my first time seeing kick bikes.

Day 3: 10.04.2023 (80km Ride):   The weather was perfect for cycling that day. Early morning, I enjoyed the view of trains running on both sides of the river. Then, we packed ourselves, had breakfast and tea, and resumed our journey.

{{< image src="images/praguebike/9.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

After a few km ride, I found an excellent place to fly my drone. But unfortunately, I was unable to connect my phone to the drone, and I couldn't fly. So, we went on with our ride. The road to our next stop, i.e., Litomerice, was mainly unpaved. The day was bright and sunny. We reached Litomerice around 10 am. We rode through the Litomerice, a city known for Viticulture and winemaking. After roaming for 10 mins, we stopped at a cafe to charge our phones, freshen ourselves, and fill our water bottles. Then, we sat outside and had a Bagel and hot chocolate.

{{< image src="images/praguebike/10.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

Meanwhile, we saw many kids with ribboned twigs and basket roaming around with their dads. (The twig is a braided one called pomlázka, made from pussy-willow twigs. The baskets are for collecting easter eggs(Krallice, a decorated egg) or candy.)  On easter Monday, Boys would whip girls lightly on the legs and possibly douse them with water. Then, the boy would recite an Easter carol, usually asking for an egg or two, while whipping. The girl would then reward the boy with a painted egg or candy and tie a ribbon around his pomlázka.* It was an intriguing tradition. While sitting outside, we enjoyed the view of the old city. An hour later, we resumed our ride. As we cycled downstream, we saw many people fishing along the banks of the river. They parked their cars and camped along the bank in tents, sitting on their chair leisurely—Fishing enthusiasts casting their lines and trying their luck at catching fish while enjoying the scenic views along the Elbe Radweg. But one must have a permit and license to fish in the Elbe in the Czech Republic. Fishing is a popular activity along the Elbe Radweg(bike route).

After around 13km, we took a small break on the outskirts of  Lounky, a small village. We tried to make a cool video of our biking trip, and that's when I realized my tire got flat. The day was not going well —first, my drone and then the flat tire. It was not a big problem, as we had all the necessary equipment to repair it. But, still, it isn't enjoyable. Upon closer look, it was worse —the tire got busted along with the tube due to some sharp object. I did carry a spare tube, but not a tire. So, we had to do Jugaad(hack), repair the tube and tire, and hope for no more damage.

{{< image src="images/praguebike/13.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}
 
As we resumed our ride, we met a group of 5 people riding and rode along with them for a while. Two of the five had many panniers(front, back, side) and equipment. It was as if they were on a world tour. My hunch was correct. They were on a world tour(for around one and half years)—Two of the five were on a world trip, and the rest three would accompany them for a 10-day bike ride. That sounds exciting and thrilling—A world tour on a bike would be one hell of an adventure. I want to do that once in my life. It's on my bucket list. I hope to cross this one in this lifetime.

{{< image src="images/praguebike/c2.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

After around 30km, we reached Roudnice and Labem with them. Here, we had to dismount and carry our bikes across the bridge, as there was some construction work on the bike road. It was a bit of a hassle, but it was too much for them, as they had a lot of luggage on their bikes. So we all took a break for a while on the bridge. We got to know each other during the break and chatted about their world tour plans—It's too much of a hassle to sort the visas for different countries. After the break, we had to part with them, as they had a different plan, even though the destination was the same for some time, i.e., Prague.

As the day progressed, the weather—Sunny yet not too hot and a cool breeze for the river made it perfect for the ride. As we rode through, we passed through beautiful villages and small charming towns along the river. We also passed by many people riding inline skates, horses, and kick bikes. As we continued cycling downstream, we met the group of 5 again. This time, we rode behind them in a line to shield ourselves against the wind and, in no time, reached Melnik, a picturesque town known for its beautiful castle perched on a hill overlooking the city. We first considered visiting it, but then we had to ride the hill, which would have been too tiresome. So, we dropped the idea, skipped the town, and continued the ride. Unfortunately, we again had to part with the group of 5, as they wanted to visit Melnik and refill their food for the tour. It was already 5 pm by then. It's time to sort out our sleeping place for the night.

After Melnik, we had to deviate from the Elbe and ride through forests and fields. However, it still was a well-marked road. We were done with the Elbe, and another river called Vltava came later. Along the way, we saw that we were very low on water. So we looked for a cafe and found an ice cream shop set for bike riders. We had cool melon ice cream, refilled our bottles, and resumed our ride. As we moved on, we crossed an incredible bike bridge to another side of the river Vltava. We found an abandoned house, a big shed, and an enormous abandoned skeleton apartment nearby a while later.

First, we looked around the house, it smelled awful, and ruins were everywhere. The abandoned house was the perfect setting for a horror movie. However, it was not a place to sleep for a night. So, we looked in the shed; it was a bit dirty. A bit of cleaning would do the work, and we could sleep there. But still, there was one more building left to look at—an enormous abandoned skeleton apartment. We tried to enter the abandoned apartment—around a five-storied building but couldn't find an entrance. So, we peeked through a windowless window to look in—Ohh man... There were giant holes in the ground floor with ruins all around, giving us the eerie haunted house feeling. Out of the three, the shed was a better place. So, we returned to the shed, parked our bikes, and cleaned the place. There was a bus stop just 10 meters away from there. It was a bit weird, as no one lives there, and the nearby village is around 1.5 km away. I lamanted  I lamented that I couldn't use the new hammock I bought for this trip. My roomie sarcastically suggested I open the hammock and sleep on it for a few minutes for my satisfaction.

{{< image src="images/praguebike/c1.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

We took our sleeping pad, sat on it outside of the shed, and had a tasty dinner while enjoying the sunset. After filling my stomach, I wanted to run around the nearby village—Všestudy and I did. So, I went for a 3km run, looked around the village, and enjoyed the run in the sun. But, after that, I was done. I had no more energy left. So, I went to the shed to make my bed and sleep. Luckily, I found a foam mattress, albeit a bit dirty. I then looked around and saw a clean banner hanging nearby that was big enough to cover the foam mattress. And that's how I made a king bed in an abandoned shed. I was proud of myself.

I slept like a baby in my sleeping bag on the self-made king's bed till 2 am. Then, at around 2 am, someone pulled my hair lightly, and my eyes opened slightly. I popped my Head out of the sleeping bag and found not one but five people standing there. I was utterly taken aback by aghast by their shabby and sudden appearance. My eyes opened entirely, and I was shivering, unable to think and talk. I looked for my roomie, but he was in a deep sleep in his sleeping bag. I tried to wake him up but avail. They were murmuring something; I couldn't understand what they were trying to say. Finally, one of them approached me and whispered something in my ear. It was something in the Czech language. I spoke with a heavy breath, "I don't understand  . . ." I wiped the sweat on my face. "What you are saying . . ." My answer irked him. In a fit of anger, he held my neck in his hand and threw me onto the wall with a vast force, and then I woke up.


Day 4: 11.04.2023(35km):   It was already 8 am. It was just a dream. My roomie was beside me, having his breakfast. I told him about my nightmare dream. He said, with a laugh," You stole their precious bed. Maybe that's why the ghosts came into your dream to haunt you and ruin your sleep. By the way, look around. A surprise for you" I looked around. It really was a surprise; it was raining—the worst thing to happen on a bike ride. It ruins the ride completely. I also didn't have the proper clothing for the rain. I only had a rain jacket, but that's not enough for the complete body. But, still, we had to go on. One has to pay the price for every decision one makes. Yep, it's my turn to pay for not hearing my roomie's words in Germany to buy proper rain clothing for biking and getting wet.

{{< image src="images/praguebike/14.jpg" caption="Sunset on the next day" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q90" class="img-fluid" title="Image Title" webp="true" >}}

We could only hope the rain would disappear and let the sun come. After breakfast, we resumed our ride—the final 35km to Prague. The rain made our ride a bit slower. After around 10km, we met an older man biking to Prague. We conversed along the way. He was a bike enthusiast from Sweden. He is biking from Hamburg to Prague along the Elbe River. He started his ride ten days ago. Even though he rode a lot and was old, he was faster than us. But we had to keep up with him. We chatted about bike rides along the way. He was a funny and friendly man.

As we pedaled, we passed through charming villages, beautiful landscapes, and an old bridge. One of the highlights of this stretch is riding through a lush forest. Usually, it would have been fun, but it became a bit adventurous due to the rain, and the way was a lot slippery and uphill. Finally, after 3 hours, we approached Prague. As we did, the Elbe Radweg took us through the city's outskirts, passing by suburbs and parks along the riverbanks. As we entered Prague, we cycled along the riverfront and had to part with our Swedish guest and with the rain. He took a photo of us and thanked us for the company. Our hostel was in the old town of Prague. We had a heavy Georgian Cuisine for lunch in the old Prague town. We then went to Prague supermarket to refill items needed for the return journey of my roomie, as my roomie was traveling by bike back to Germany. We realized things are around 50 percent costlier in Prague than in the rest of Czech due to Tourism. Finally, it started becoming sunny, and it was good.

>In Prague, I liked the city's speed breakers design. They are mainly designed to allow bikes without any problem but not for Cars or any other vehicle.

We then walked through the beautiful cobblestone streets in Prague and passed through Prague Astronomical Clock(The famous medieval clock first installed in 1410 in Prague's Old Town Square with an hourly "Procession of the Apostles" show and ornate design.). We then went to a souvenir shop and bought some postcards. Then we had a vanilla Trdelník ice cream, famous in Prague. There are long queues around shops to buy Trdelník ice cream, although it's a bit costly. After a conversation with a local vendor, I learned that the trdelník is not a traditional Czech food. The name is Czech but not the dessert. Many old Czech people didn't know it before. They are just made for tourists and are famous because they are very Instagrammable. I had it whenever I visited Prague. It's very delicious, and I recommend trying one.

Then we went to our hostel Safestay Hostel. It was cheap, 16€ per person for a night in the city center, albeit there was no parking place for cycles and everything else we needed to pay for. Finally, we went to our rooms, and I had a fresh bath for an hour after riding around for four days without a bath. It was already 5 pm.

We went for a walk in the city and had some fun.We walked around Charles Bridge and enjoyed the tourist atmosphere with the music on the bridge. We then visited the local easter market and enjoyed the local artistic activities and food.

We then walked to the Franz Kafka - Rotating 42-layer Kinetic Head statue, a unique twisting and iconic reflective sculpture that rotates once an hour. It reflects the themes and style of Kafka's literary works, which often explored the complexities of human existence and the absurdity of modern society. Franz Kafka was a Czech writer born in Prague. It's a technical marvel.The night came, and we saw a pub, had local Czech Prague cider, and chatted with the bartender about Prague and other things.
We were done for the day, returned to our hostels, and slept well.

Day 5: 12.04.2023(11.6km):   My last day in Prague. After our heavy breakfast in the hostel, I parted with my roomie, as our plans were different for the return trip. I checked out of the hostel, rode my bike to the train station, and stored my luggage in the locker for the rest of the day. I then set on for a bike ride in Prague for the day. First, I rode to the top of Letná hill, along the Letná park, and then to the lesser town Malá Strana, a hillside area across the Vltava River to the old town Prague, where Prague Castle is located. One can have a beautiful panoramic view of Prague's old town from the top of Letná Hill.

I skipped visiting Prague Castle, as it takes too much time, and I already saw it during my first visit to Prague. So, instead, I had a delicious Trdelník and a coffee and read a book. Then, I walked with my bike on the Charles Bridge, a bustling pedestrian area with street artists, musicians, and vendors selling souvenirs, paintings, and crafts. I enjoyed the lively atmosphere and experienced the local culture. It is also one of the most iconic landmarks of the city, known for its stunning Gothic architecture, statues, and breathtaking views of Prague Castle and the surrounding area.

In addition, Prague is full of shops that sell products containing Cannabis. After a talk with the shop vendor, I learned that it's not Cannabis but cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound found in Cannabis. While the use of Cannabis is decriminalized in the Czech Republic, it is still technically illegal to sell or possess it in large amounts, but cannabidiol is legal. One can find shops that sell various CBD products, such as oils, creams, edibles, and even hemp-based clothing.

I then rode on to Dancing House, a unique building standing out for its unconventional design, which resembles a pair of dancers in motion.I just had an hour left for my train back and was tired. I then rode into the old town, riding behind trams, finding my way back to the station, and enjoying my time. Finally, I returned to the station, took my luggage, and took the train back to Germany.

>The ride was a fun, challenging, and exciting one. I was relieved that I completed the ride without any mishaps or difficulties. Most importantly, I met the entire five-day travel for under 100€.
